## Python Linter

- The Python code was validated using flakes8 as recommended by the Code Institute. Therefore I opted for running the python linter Flake8 in editor via the CLI with python3.8 -m flake8.
- Any files auto-generated by Django or not written by myself were ignored in terminal output.
- My written code was corrected according the flake 8 standard.
